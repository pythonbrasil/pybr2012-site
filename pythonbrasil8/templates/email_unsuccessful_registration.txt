Dear {{ profile.name }},

PythonBrasil[8] Conference will be held during November 23 and 24, 2012 at SulAmérica Convention Center.

Apparently you tried to pay the fee, related to a {{ profile.type }} registration at PythonBrasil[8], but the transaction did not succeed.

If you payed with billet ("boleto bancário") and are receiving this email, please, report the problem to PagSeguro using:
https://pagseguro.uol.com.br/atendimento/atendimentos.jhtml

And let us know. Otherwise, please, try paying it again from our website:

If you need assistance, you can email us at organizacao@python.org.br.

Thank you,

PythonBrasil Conference Registration
