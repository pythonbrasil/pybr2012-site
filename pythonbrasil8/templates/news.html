            Provided the partnership with PyAr, the Argentinian Python community, the PythonBrasil[8] conference will be able to gather several international recognized keynotes.
            <br><br>
            Despite this partnership, as the conference is organized by the Python community for the community, we are doing a public survey to know who the attendees of the conference would like to watch speaking as keynotes. The survey has open questions - so you are free to suggest your favorite developers & speakers.

                Some of the partners of PythonBrasil[8] are renowned publishers, which are kindly donating books to be raffled during the conference. One of this publishers is Novatec, a Brazilian company that is supporting the community with books in Portuguese, including "Python e Django", by the current president of APyB (Brazilian Python Association) - Osvaldo Santana.
                <br><br>
                Among the partners, there is also the international publisher O'Reilly, responsible for the "Python Cookbook", written by the trio Alex Martelli, Anna Ravenscroft and David Ascher. Another publisher that is also supporting PythonBrasil[8] is Pearson, responsible for the famous "Python Essential Reference", by David M. Beazley.
                <br><br>
                The excellent news is: not only these two international publishers will donate books, but they are also giving our community the chance of deciding which books will be donated! There are extremelly new titles (from 2012!) on several topics related to Python, including Python 3k and how to mine the social web with the programming language.
