PythonBrasil[8] website
=======================

This is the source-code of PythonBrasil[8]'s website. The 8th edition of the conference will happen during November 2012, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The official website is under-construction and can be seen at:
http://www.pythonbrasil.org.br

Since its begining, this website has been developed as open-source by volunteers, using mainly:

- Python
- Django

One of our major concerns was reusability of code. Due to this, we decided to develop and improve a conference Django app, called Mittun:
https://github.com/flaviamissi/mittun

The aim of this app is to provide features useful to any conference website. One of the qualities of Mittun, when compared to other similar projects, is its test coverage. Whenever possible, TDD (Test Driven Development) was used.
